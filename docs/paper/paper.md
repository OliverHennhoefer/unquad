# Summary

The requirement of uncertainty quantification for AI systems has become increasingly important. In the context of anomaly detection applications, this directly translates to controlling Type I (False Positive) error rates without compromising the statistical power of the applied detection procedure. Conformal Anomaly Detection [@Laxhammar2010] emerges as a promising approach for providing respective statistical guarantees by calibrating a given detector model. Instead of relying on anomaly scores and arbitrarily set thresholds, this approach converts the anomaly scores to statistically valid $p$-values that can then be adjusted by statistical methods that control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) [@Benjamini1995] within a set of tested instances [@Bates2023].

The Python library `unquad` is an open-source software package that provides a range of tools to enable conformal inference [@Papadopoulos2002; @Vovk2005; @Lei2012] for one-class classification [@Petsche1994]. The library computes classical and weighted conformal $p$-values [@Jin2023] using different conformalization strategies that make them suitable for application even in low-data regimes [@Hennhofer2024]. The library integrates with the majority of `pyod` anomaly detection models [@Zhao2019; @Zhao2024].

# Statement of Need

The field of anomaly detection comprises methods for identifying observations that either deviate from the majority of observations or otherwise do not *conform* to an expected state of *normality*. The typical procedure leverages anomaly scores and thresholds to distinguish in-distribution data from out-of-distribution data. However, this approach does not provide statistical guarantees regarding its estimates. A major concern in anomaly detection is the rate of False Positives among proclaimed discoveries. Depending on the domain, False Positives can be expensive. Triggering *false alarms* too often results in *alert fatigue* and eventually renders the detection system ineffective and impractical.

In such contexts, it is necessary to control the proportion of False Positives relative to the entirety of proclaimed discoveries (the number of triggered alerts). In practice, this is measured by the FDR, which translates to:
$$
FDR=\frac{\text{Efforts Wasted on False Alarms}}{\text{Total Efforts}}
$$
[@Benjamini1995; @Benjamini2009]. 

Framing anomaly detection tasks as sets of statistical hypothesis tests, with $H_0$ claiming that the data is *normal* (no *discovery* to be made), enables controlling the FDR when statistically valid $p$-values (or test statistics) are available. When conducting multiple *simultaneous* hypothesis tests, it is furthermore necessary to *adjust* for multiple testing, as fixed *significance levels* (typically $\alpha \leq 0.05$) would lead to inflated overall error rates.

The `unquad` (*<ins>un</ins>certainty-<ins>qu</ins>antified <ins>a</ins>nomaly <ins>d</ins>etection*) package provides the tools necessary for creating anomaly detectors whose outputs can be statistically controlled to cap the (*marginal*) FDR at a nominal level. It provides wrappers for a wide range of anomaly detectors (e.g., [Variational-]Autoencoder, IsolationForest, One-Class SVM) complemented by a rich range of conformalization strategies (mostly depending on the *data regime*) to compute classical conformal $p$-values or modified *weighted* conformal $p$-values. The need for *weighted* conformal $p$-values arises when the underlying statistical assumption of *exchangeability* is violated due to covariate shift between calibration and test data. Finally, `unquad` offers built-in statistical adjustment measures like Benjamini-Hochberg [@Benjamini1995] that correct obtained and statistically valid $p$-values for the multiple testing problem when testing a *batch* of observations simultaneously.

# Features

## Core Functionality

The library provides:
- **Seamless integration** with PyOD detectors through a unified API
- **Multiple conformalization strategies**: inductive, leave-one-out, cross-conformal, and bootstrap
- **Weighted conformal p-values** for handling covariate shift
- **FDR control** via Benjamini-Hochberg and other procedures

### Conformal P-Values

Given a nonconformity score function $s(\cdot)$ and calibration set $D_{\text{calib}} = \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$, the classical conformal p-value for test instance $X_{\text{test}}$ is:

$$p(X_{\text{test}}) = \frac{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}\{s(X_i) \geq s(X_{\text{test}})\}}{n+1}$$

Under exchangeability, this p-value is marginally valid: $\mathbb{P}(p(X_{\text{test}}) \leq \alpha) \leq \alpha$ for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

### Handling Covariate Shift

When test data comes from a different distribution $Q$ than calibration data distribution $P$, weighted conformal p-values restore validity [@Jin2023; @Tibshirani2019]:

$$p_{\text{weighted}}(X_{\text{test}}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w(X_i) \mathbf{1}\{s(X_i) > s(X_{\text{test}})\} + U \cdot \text{ties}}{\sum_{i=1}^n w(X_i) + w(X_{\text{test}})}$$

where $w(X) = \frac{dQ}{dP}(X)$ is the importance weight and $U \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$ handles ties.

### Resampling Strategies

For improved power in small-sample settings, `unquad` implements resampling-based methods [@Hennhofer2024]:
- **Leave-One-Out**: Uses n models, each trained on n-1 samples
- **Cross-Conformal**: Aggregates out-of-fold predictions
- **Bootstrap**: Leverages out-of-bag samples

These methods increase the effective calibration set size while maintaining validity under appropriate conditions.

## Future Developments

As the package mostly addressed the needs of static anomaly detection for (approximately) exchangeable data the package can no directly be applied to more advanced tasks in anomaly detection, like real-time anomaly detection.
Therefore, we plan to release more features that directly address the specific needs that arise during temporal applications of anomaly detection.
