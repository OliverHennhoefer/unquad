    """Calculate p-values for scores based on a calibration set.

    This function computes a p-value for each score in the `scores` array by
    comparing it against the distribution of scores in the `calibration_set`.
    The p-value represents the proportion of calibration scores that are
    greater than or equal to the given score, with a small adjustment.

    The `@performance_conversion` decorator ensures that `scores` and
    `calibration_set` are ``numpy.ndarray`` objects internally and that the
    returned ``numpy.ndarray`` of p-values is converted to a ``list[float]``.

    Args:
        scores (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array of test scores for which p-values
            are to be calculated. Can be passed as a list, which the
            decorator will convert.
        calibration_set (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array of calibration scores
            used as the reference distribution. Can be passed as a list,
            which the decorator will convert.

    Returns
    -------
        list[float]: A list of p-values, each corresponding to an input score
            from `scores`.

    Notes
    -----
        The p-value for each score is computed using the formula:
        p_value = (1 + count(calibration_score >= score)) / (1 + N_calibration)
        where N_calibration is the total number of scores in `calibration_set`.

    This function computes p-values by comparing input `scores` (with
    corresponding `w_scores` weights) against a `calibration_set` (with
    `w_calib` weights). The calculation involves a weighted count of
    calibration scores exceeding each test score, incorporating the weights
    of both the test scores and calibration scores.

    The `@performance_conversion` decorator handles `scores` and
    `calibration_set`, converting them to ``numpy.ndarray`` if they are lists
    and converting the ``numpy.ndarray`` result to ``list[float]``.
    Note: `w_scores` and `w_calib` are NOT automatically converted by this
    decorator instance and must be provided as ``numpy.ndarray`` objects.

    Args:
        scores (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array of test scores. The decorator
            allows passing a list.

            score in `calibration_set`. Must be a ``numpy.ndarray``.
